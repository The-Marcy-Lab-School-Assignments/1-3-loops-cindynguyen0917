# Question
In what situations is a `while` loop better than a `for` loop?

# Answer
While `for` and `while` loops are very similar you would use a for loop when you have a known number of loops you want executed ahead of your coding such as a counter. Whereas a `while` loop doesn't have a set number of loops, it would be used when you want a statement to go on and to stop only once a condition no longer proves true. `for` loops are numeric where `while` loops are conditional.
